# Governance

This document defines the governance model for Waystone.

Waystone is intended to be a serious infrastructure and project-portability tool. Governance should therefore be clear, practical and proportionate to the current stage of the project.

## Purpose

The purpose of governance in Waystone is to:
- define who is responsible for project direction and repository decisions
- make merge and release authority clear
- provide a stable basis for review, contribution and maintenance
- reduce ambiguity around decision-making
- avoid project drift caused by unclear ownership or informal process

## Current Model

Waystone currently uses a maintainer-led governance model.

At this stage, the project is controlled by its maintainer or maintainers. Decisions are made by the maintainers with primary authority resting with the core maintainers unless and until the governance model is changed.

## Roles

Waystone currently recognises the following roles:

### Core Maintainer(s)

The core maintainers are responsible for:
- defining and protecting project direction
- approving or declining architectural changes
- setting repository standards and contribution expectations
- deciding release readiness
- managing security response and disclosure decisions
- appointing or removing maintainers
- amending governance when necessary

### Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for:
- reviewing contributions
- protecting the project's scope, security posture and quality standards
- merging changes within their authority
- helping manage issues, pull requests and documentation
- escalating major architectural or security decisions when appropriate

### Contributors

Contributors may:
- report bugs
- suggest improvements
- submit pull requests
- participate in project discussion

Contributors do not have merge or release authority unless they are also maintainers.

## Decision-making

Waystone prefers clear maintainer decisions over vague consensus language.

Input from contributors is welcome but maintainers are responsible for making final decisions about:
- whether a change fits the project
- whether a pull request will be merged
- whether a release is ready
- whether a proposed change requires a recorded decision
- whether a contribution conflicts with the project's scope, security model or standards

For major changes, maintainers should prefer recorded reasoning over ad hoc judgement.

## Merge Authority

No pull request should be merged solely because it is technically functional.

A pull request may be merged only if it:
- fits the project's scope and direction
- meets the documented standards
- is understandable and reviewable
- does not introduce unacceptable security or maintenance risk
- has been reviewed by an authorised maintainer

Sensitive areas may require stricter review.

## Release Authority

Releases are authorised by the core maintainers.

A release should not be made unless the maintainers are satisfied that it meets the project's stated release, security and quality expectations.

## Security Decisions

Security-sensitive decisions, including coordinated disclosure timing, remediation direction and security advisory publication are handled by the maintainers.

Where necessary, the core maintainers have final authority.

## Recorded Decisions

Material architectural and project-boundary decisions should be recorded under [`docs/architecture/decisions/`](docs/architecture/decisions/).

Governance changes, scope changes and other significant changes should not rely only on chat, memory or issue discussion.

## Adding Maintainers

A maintainer may be added when the core maintainers judge that the person has demonstrated:
- consistent good judgement
- understanding of the project's direction
- review quality
- technical competence
- reliable and constructive participation

Maintainer status is not automatic and is not granted based only on contribution count.

## Removing Maintainers

A maintainer may be removed if they:
- act against the project's interests
- repeatedly undermine the documented direction of the project
- fail to meet expected standards of judgement or conduct
- become inactive for an extended period where that creates project risk
- no longer wish to serve in the role

## Governance Changes

This document is the canonical governance document for Waystone.

Changes to the governance model should be made deliberately and should reflect the actual needs of the project rather than process for its own sake.
